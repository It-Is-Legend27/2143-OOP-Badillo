## PO2 - MyVector Class 2
### Angel Badillo
### Description:

This program implements a class called MyVector that is essentially
a double linked list with overloaded constuctors that can append
or prepend a double linked list to another double linked list.
It can also add items to a specific location, search for an item
and return the index, and remove an item at a specific location.
In this second program, the [] bracket operator, equal-to operator,
the not equal-to operator, the compound assignment operators and 
arithmetic are implemented, so you can treat the vector as an array,
check for equality, use compound assignment, and add, subtract,
multiply, and divide.
